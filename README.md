## Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine using the linear regression algorithm. We will be using a dataset containing various features of wines along with their corresponding quality ratings. The linear regression model will be trained on this data to learn the relationship between the features and wine quality and then used to make predictions on new data.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality (target variable)

This dataset consists of various features related to wine properties, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and the quality rating. We will use this data to build a machine learning model for wine quality prediction using the linear regression algorithm.

### Libraries Used

We will be using the following Python libraries for this project:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For data visualization
- seaborn: For advanced data visualization
- scikit-learn: For implementing the linear regression model and evaluation
